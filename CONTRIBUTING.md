## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Stable release branch
- `develop` - Development branch (if applicable)
- Feature branches: `feature/your-feature-name`
- Bug fixes: `fix/issue-description`

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following the coding standards

3. Test your changes:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet test  # If tests exist
   ```

4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```

5. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. Create a Pull Request

## Coding Standards

### C# Style Guide

- Follow Microsoft's C# Coding Conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and small
- Use LINQ where appropriate

Example:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Gets a token by name and optional language code.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="name">The token name</param>
/// <param name="languageCode">Optional language code</param>
/// <returns>The token if found, otherwise null</returns>
public ContentToken? GetToken(string name, string? languageCode = null)
{
    // Implementation
}
```

### JavaScript/Dojo Style Guide

- Use semicolons
- Use double quotes for strings
- Follow Dojo module pattern
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Loads all tokens from the API
 */
loadTokens: function () {
    // Implementation
}
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use meaningful test names

Example:
```csharp
[Fact]
public void ReplaceTokens_ShouldReplaceSimpleToken()
{
    // Arrange
    var service = new ContentTokenService();
    var token = new ContentToken { Name = "Test", Value = "Value" };
    service.SaveToken(token);
    
    // Act
    var result = service.ReplaceTokens("Hello {{Test}}!");
    
    // Assert
    Assert.Equal("Hello Value!", result);
}
```

### Integration Tests

- Test end-to-end scenarios
- Use the example project for manual testing
- Verify token replacement in various contexts
